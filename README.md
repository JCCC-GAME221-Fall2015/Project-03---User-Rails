#Project 3 – User Rails

##Pull Request Name: Project 03 User Rails <team name>

In this project you will be expanding upon the rail shooter you made in the last project.

You will be creating two things:

##Assetpackage

1. You need to edit your rail shooter tool to follow user-centered design concepts.

2. Change your editor from an inspector to a window, and allow access to all three types of manipulation that the designer will need access to (movement, facings, effects)

3. Add the remaining movement and facings that were left out of the project.

4. Export this to an assetpackage

5. ONLY INCLUDE THE NECESSARY SCRIPTS AND A SHORT TEXT FILE EXPLAINING HOW TO START THE TOOL!

6. This assetpackage will allow the user access to your rail shooter tool for creating levels.

##Level Creator
1. After the user has created the level, there should be a menu option for them to export their level
2. Movement/Effects/Facings only
3. User-supplied name and author
4. The option should create a text file with the appropriate information
5. Name of Level
6. Date it was created
7. Author of the file
8. Waypoints with options
9. The user will then need to place this file inside a folder in the BUILT game data
10. When the user runs the game, the game should read in all cursory information about each level in the folder
11. Name, Date, Author
12. Display the information inside of a menu
13. Allow the user to select which level he/she wishes to play
14. Include a default, embedded level in case there are no User-Generated levels
15. Read the rest of the data for the level and display the level to the user
